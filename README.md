CAR INSURANCE PROJECT:
As a dedicated QA professional, I specialize in executing comprehensive selenium automation testing for car insurance websites. My primary focus is on ensuring the seamless functionality of critical features such as the registration form, login-logout process, quotation retrieval, and profile editing. To achieve this, I meticulously design effective test cases and scenarios, which are then executed using a combination of tools like Excel, Chrome, Edge, and Word. To further enhance my testing capabilities, I have implemented a data-driven framework in conjunction with Selenium and JavaScript, allowing me to efficiently manage and execute tests with varying input data. This approach not only saves time but also ensures the accuracy and reliability of my test results, ultimately contributing to the overall quality and performance of the car insurance website.
